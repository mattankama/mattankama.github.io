# Rattlesnake

A mobile-first web app for logging weightlifting workouts.

Every exercise auto-fills with the sets, reps and weight from the last time it was performed
**on that piece of equipment**, so you can start the set immediately and only adjust what
changed. All data stays on your phone.

## What it does

- **Routines** — reusable workout templates: a name and an ordered list of exercises.
- **Instances** — the specific machine or bar an exercise was done on
  ("Hammer Strength", "Barbell"). History is tracked per instance, because 60kg on one
  machine isn't 60kg on another.
- **Sessions** — start a routine, pick an instance per exercise, and the sets you did last
  time appear pre-filled. An exercise with only one instance is filled in for you.
- **Rest timer** — pinned to the top of the session screen and counts up. It resets itself every
  time you tick off a set.
- **Progress** — a weight trend for one exercise on one instance, plus the exact numbers.
