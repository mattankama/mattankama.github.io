/**
 * Rattlesnake — offline shell.
 *
 * There is no API to be offline from: the data is on the phone. What this
 * worker adds is the app itself — the HTML, CSS, JS and font — so that opening
 * Rattlesnake in a basement gym with no bars of signal is the same as opening
 * it at home.
 *
 * Served from the site root (not /static/) because a worker can only control
 * pages at or below its own path, and this one has to control all of them.

 * 1. The query string. `/session/?id=2` and `/session/?id=9` are the same file —
 *    which session it is gets read by the page, not chosen by the server. Matched
 *    literally, every session would be a miss.
 * 2. The trailing slash. Hosts disagree about whether `/progress` or `/progress/`
 *    is canonical and redirect to whichever they prefer. Online that redirect is
 *    invisible; offline there is nobody to serve it, so the form the lifter
 *    happens to arrive with has to hit the copy we actually stored.
