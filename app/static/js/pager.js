/**
 * Rattlesnake — Pager
 *
 * Home and Progress are two panes of a single document, laid side by side on one
 * track. The track follows the finger through the whole drag and snaps to the
 * nearest pane on release — direct manipulation, the way a phone's tab strip
 * behaves, rather than a flick that triggers an animation afterwards.
 *
 * That is only possible because nothing navigates. Both panes are in the DOM and
 * both have already loaded their data, so there is no request to wait on, no
 * blank frame to cover, and the content under your finger is real at every point
 * in the gesture.
 *
 * The URL is kept in step with replaceState, so a reload — or opening /progress
 * directly — lands on the pane you were looking at, without filling the history
 * stack with one entry per swipe.
 *
 * The one hard part is deciding, from the first few pixels, whether a finger is
 * swiping the track or scrolling a pane — and then holding on to that decision.
 * Both halves are spelled out where they happen, in bindDrag.

 * gesture that dies because it began 30px too high is exactly the kind of "it
 * didn't take" this pager is trying to stop having. What a control buys is a

// 0.55 is a ~61° cone around the horizontal. Note what it does as a gesture
// grows: the allowance is generous in absolute terms and strict in relative
